# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
It was difficult to find out when to use [] and when to use (). I was also confused with what type of code to use and what the code does. In the end I looked over the code and the asserts and figured it out and understood it a bit better. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
It could help to match words with certain answers and what to return. It will also help the program identify what goes with what and return the right result. One of the matches could be for a movie and a year and access the movie database.
